# Personal Portfolio Website (v1.0) 

![Portfolio Screenshot](https://github.com/ctd08/Website-Static/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202025-09-03%20232651.png)

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, built from the ground up using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project was a deliberate exercise to master core front-end technologies through practical application, bridging the gap between my backend/embedded focus and modern web development.

## 🎯 About The Project

The primary goal of this project was to build a complete, functional, and aesthetically pleasing portfolio without relying on any front-end frameworks like React or Vue. Every interactive feature was implemented with vanilla JavaScript to ensure a deep understanding of the underlying DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management.

This hands-on approach was motivated by my interest in **MedTech**, a field where robust system functionality and intuitive user interface design are equally critical.

## 🛠️ Built With

This project was built using only foundational web technologies.

- **HTML5:** For semantic and accessible content structure.
- **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and animations.
  - **Custom Properties (Variables):** For easy theme management (Light/Dark modes).
  - **Transitions:** For smooth animations on the sidebar, dropdowns, and buttons.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6):** For all interactivity and DOM manipulation. No libraries or frameworks were used.
- **Font Awesome:** For icons.

## ✨ Features

The website includes a range of features implemented from scratch:

- **🌓 Dark/Light Mode:** A theme toggle that saves the user's preference in their browser's `localStorage`.
- **↔️ Collapsible Sidebar:** A smooth, animated sidebar for clean navigation.
- **📁 Dropdown CV Menu:** An interactive dropdown in the navigation to download English and German versions of my CV.
- **🔍 Project Filtering:** On the projects page, users can filter the timeline by technology tags.
- **⬆️ Scroll-to-Top Button:** Appears on scroll and provides a smooth scroll back to the top of the page.
- **📝 Clean, Documented Code:** The entire codebase is commented to explain structure, logic, and intent.

## 🔮 Future Improvements (v2.0)

This project serves as the foundation for a more advanced version. The planned roadmap includes:

- **Migration to React:** Rebuilding the entire front-end with React for a more modular, component-based architecture.
- **Full Responsiveness:** Implementing CSS media queries to ensure the layout adapts perfectly to mobile and tablet screens.
- **Functional Search Bar:** Implementing a live search that filters projects and content in real-time.
- **Backend Integration:** Adding a backend (e.g., Node.js) to handle a functional contact form.
